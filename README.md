# whatsapp-assistant 
a whatsapp web bassed appiontment booking system
a basic whatsapp assistant to receive the name from one client and text client whose name was mentioned by client1
the people.txt file contains the list of names which will apper when a person texts to choose from and these name must be saved in the contanct of the person running this application.

Also the location of webdrivers must be present in the path variable

now its only one way communication via the host between the person who wants to book an appointment to the person whith whoom he wants to book with.

the next upgrade will contain both sided comunication via the host and will appear as an channel whtough which two people can communicate without having each others phone number directly. but the only the host knows both the people.

if someone can help implementing ML on the text received from client do mail at hitzzkushwaha@gmail.com
